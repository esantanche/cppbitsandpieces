# Project starter

This app shows a list of projects. 

I use it to open URLs, files and apps I need for a project.

If I'm working every day on a project, I need to open every time the same files, URLs and apps.

This app does the job for me.

I have to configure it in a json file called projectstarterconfiguration.json.

See the document JSON_CONFIG_FORMAT.md for an explanation of the information you have to 
provide for the app to open the files you need.

The JSON library I use is: https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson/
