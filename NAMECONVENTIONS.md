# Name conventions

These are the name conventions used in these projects.

Names of variables and classes are in CamelCase.

Names of functions and methods are like this: on_button_cancel

For variables these prefixes are used:

* c for constants/readonlys
* e for events
* i for indexes and iterators (it can be used as well for variables that represent the current item in a loop)
* m for members
* n for collections (arrays and vectors)
* p for pointer (and pp for pointer to pointer)
* s for static
* u for unsafe
* v for volatile

Prefixes are used in alphabetic order

Examples

* cnTasks is a constant and it's an array of tasks
* mVBox is a member of a class
* iProjectName is a interator in a for loop
* nProjectNames is a vector
* iTask is a variable in a cycle whose content varies at each cycle
